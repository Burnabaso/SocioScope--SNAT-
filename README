# SocioScope

#### Done by: Ibrahim Itani

The purpose of this project is to build a **Social Network Analysis Tool** called *"SocioScope"*

> This project is part of the Fundamentals of Computer Science Bootcamp organized by SE-Factory LB.

> The language used in this project is **Python**

> SocioScope is fairly simple to use

### To test is all the user has to do is run the simple **main.py** file.
#### The "main.py" file will be the entry point and fully coordinate all the operations SocioScope Offers based on the user's input and interaction

> All the other functionalities python files are hidden in the src folder not to intimidate the user with the amount of files used to operate this SNAT (Social Network Analysis Tool) 

# How to Use:

## (1) The tool prompts the user to login (""" ! Note that login users are already hard coded and can be accessed in the ./Data/LoginData.json file""")
> For simplicity only 2 users are allowed to access SocioScope
> if the username contains a **1** at the end of the name => He/She are **Editors** (can view/add/delete/alter relationships & has full control inside SocioScope)
> if the username contains a **2** at the end of the name => He/She are **Viewers** (can view users details and relationships but has no admin privileges)
> For example if the username is john231 **Notice the 1 at the end this indicates that john231 is an editor**

## (2) After a successful login and depending on the User privilege a specific cli will be prompted clarifying the allowed operations the user can perform
